                     HORRIBLE BUGS & ISSUES ABOUND

              THIS ARCHIVE IS ONLY FOR HISTORICAL PURPOSES
=======================================================================

This is an archived version of the support infrastructure that was used
for building the works at:

https://github.com/hardboiledbabylon/athenaeum_miscellanea

It is mostly for historical purposes only, though can serve as a
real-world usage example for the programs available at:

https://github.com/hardboiledbabylon/fisml

The build system is designed to turn FISML projects into PDF
and EPUB documents.  PDF generation is ultimately handled by LuaLaTex
and Ghostscript.  EPUB generation is handled completely internally.

Documentation is sparse and internal and likely never to be anything
better.
